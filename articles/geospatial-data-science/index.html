           INTRODUCTION
      ========================== -->
      <section id="introduction" class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>How did we get here?</h3>

        <p>
          Geospatial isn’t only about geographic sciences. But also, about data and information
          technologies. Especially ever since the introduction of the global navigation satellite
          system (GNSS). However, both the geospatial and informational were either limited or
          separated for a long time. GPS technologies accelerated quickly over the past few decades.
          But it wasn’t an easy pursuit. It dates back to when, in order to satisfy their argument
          with the English about the shape of the Earth, the French sent out two expeditions to make
          spatial measurements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The French Cassini’s postulated that the Earth was elongated. While Isaac Newton deduced
          that it was flattened. In 1735 La Condamine and Bouguer went to what was then called Peru
          -in modern day Ecuador- to perform a measurement on a piece of a meridian. They spent nine
          years there. Then, in 1736, De Maupertuis spent a year and half in what which was then
          called Lapland in modern day Finland to do a similar land survey measurement.
        </p>

        <p>
          Contrary to what was originally anticipated. The French survey measurements affirmed that
          the Earth was indeed flattened -as Newton originally anticipated with mathematic and
          without ever leaving his desk. Those were the early expeditions that initiated Earth
          measurement sciences as we have them today.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1807 President Thomas Jefferson, who was a surveyor himself, created the Survey of the
          Coast. Which included geodetic and astronomical survey tools to measure the Earth. Most of
          these tools were imported from Europe until the 1890s. The Coast Survey conducted monumental
          work across the U.S. collecting millions of data points on the ground in order to build
          complex mathematical models of the Earth. This later became the mapping system for the
          United States. Much of the work that these brave surveyors did over the past few decades
          laid out the groundwork for the evolution of GPS. In 1960 the U.S. Cost Survey figured out
          a way to use the Echo 1 satellite for global measurements of the earth. This initiated the
          development of the global satellite navigation network between 1964-1973. In 1970 the Coast
          Survey became the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) under NOAA.
        </p>

        <p>
          The high costs associated with satellites and mapping systems limited their access to
          government and military for a long time. But technological and industrial revolutions that
          have flattened the way over the past few decades lowered their barriers to entry. Anyone
          today can make geospatial measurements and conduct complex statistical and mathematical
          methods of the entire world without leaving his or her desk. Just like I'm about to
          demonstrate for my case study.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          I copied all of the above information about the history of geodesy and surveying from video
          lectures by Dave Doyle, NGS, Chief Geodetic Surveyor (Retired). I included all the links to
          his awesome video lectures at the end if this page you're interested to learn a ton more.
        </p>

        <h3>Geodatabase Project</h3>
        <p>
          The objective of my assignment was to build a geodatabase and provide a useful
          application/service. I decided to find an open area near where I live to conduct a survey.
          So, I went to SeaWorld San Diego. What a great place to be. I created a geodatabase and
          visualized a map that can help both visitors and park management.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was able to collect seven feature layers. Then I used an imagery web map from Esri with a
          WGS84 Web Mercator datum and PCS for my base map. Especially since the my map is dependant
          on GPS. For the geodatabase creation and web maps I used ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my case study, I demonstrated the following: concepts of the spatial and temporal aspects
          of GIS; cartography and symbology; geodatabase design and creation; network data; data
          collection; and data science and AI applications.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Please note that all of the data included in my project was either publicly collected or
          fictional for the purposes of demonstration only.

            <h3>Base Map</h3>
            <p>
              I used an imagery basemap from Esri with WGS84 web mercator for the coordinate and projection
              systems. Image resolution is 0.3 meters.
            </p>

            <h3>Walkways Network</h3>
            <p>
              It took me about 2 hours to walk the whole park and collect longitude and latitude coordinates
              for my feature classes. I also used Field Maps from Esri briefly to help draw features in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, I spent a few hours on my base map to manually re-draw a walkway network and nodes.
              Neither horizontal nor vertical accuracy were important for my case study. I probably was able to
              attain 12-17 feet in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              For my walkways network, I ended up with 72 individual walkways -which were designed to look like the
              maze of an amusement park.

              For my walkway network to perform properly if I wanted to create a direction app, I'd need to setup
              my roads based on the number of junctions in the network.
            </p>
            <p>
              I created this nodes feature class manually just for visual purposes for now. I ended up with 55
              junctions and dead ends. So, in short: my network has 72 walkways and 47 turns.

        <h3>Vehicle Pass Form</h3>
        <p>
          I created a smart survey for my geodatabase using Survey123 from Esri. This survey tracks both the agent
          device location and parking/destination location. Through this app, park agents can issue vehicle passes
          and capture live information directly in the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we can georeference destination locations for real-time visualization. Or we can setup rules to limit
          issuing vehicle passes for each area based on capacity for example.

        <h2>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Spatial Data Science or AI are still new topics. They are great fields to combine because nowadays there are
          lots of commercial and open source tools that allow data science and AI processes to run from anywhere without
          the need for a data center or super computers on site.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started my journey by learning R from biostatisticians. Which gave me a strong statistical background. Then I
          learned SQL before moving to Python. I ended up needing a host for my code and ways to organize and serve it.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're doing school projects or research then a Jupyter notebook will be great for you. However, if you want
          to build apps and APIs then you'd need OOP. You can define attributes and methods, code subtypes, and create
          domains to classify your data and mitigate data entry errors.
        </p>

        <p>
          All the nonspatial attributes can be processed with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit learn, Keras, PyTorch, etc. Then we
          can use georeferencing to tie them back to your geometry. Python also has powerful GIS libraries such as GeoPandas.
